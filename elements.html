I like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk. Murf pratt ungow ungow i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box. Kitty poochy intently stare at the same spot, but hide at bottom of staircase to trip human, so my <span style="color:red">slave</span> human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor. Chase dog then run away carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle, immediately regret falling into bathtub.
